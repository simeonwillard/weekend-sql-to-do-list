To-Do List

## Description

This app makes a to-do list that the user can add tasks to, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.  The tasks are stored in a database and displayed on the DOM.  When the user adds a task, marks a task as completed, or deletes a task, the database will be updated with the new data.  When the user marks a task as completed, the table row will be highlighted and if unmarked the row will cease to be highlighted.  The database will be updated accordingly.
